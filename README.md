# Makepad Analyzer

Makepad Analyzer is a tool that provides code analysis and performance analysis for the Makepad.

The experience might be better if it's integrated with makepad-studio, but for now we'll focus more on `VS Code` in preparation for `Makepad Studio`.

## Features in Progress

- [x] Language Server: Basic language server that can be used to provide code completion, hover, and definition capabilities for the Makepad DSL.

## Features in Future

We hope that in the future it would be desirable to provide the following features:

- [ ] Language Server
- [ ] Code Analysis
- [ ] Profermance Analysis
- [ ] Tree Shaking

> [!NOTE]
> ⚠️ makepad-analyzer is a work-in-progress that doesn't yet support all features.
